# array-based-minigame
An odd based minigame built with vanilla Javascript. 
Simple array based odd minigame. Four default arrays of 1 and 2 numbers with decreasing win/lose ratio. You win if you get a 1, and lose if you get a 2. If you win, you'll enter the next round, in which it is rarer to win, until you lose/get up to round 4.
I'll try to add infinite progressive odd arrays in the meantime.
